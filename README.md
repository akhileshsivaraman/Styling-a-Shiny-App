# Styling a Shiny App

R Shiny is a fantastic tool for creating beautiful, interactive web apps. One of the most powerful features of Shiny is how easy it is to create functional apps, even if you’re new to the package. On the flip side, styling can be tricky and as a developer, you don’t just want to produce apps that work, but also stunning UIs that enhance the user experience.

There are a range of approaches to styling Shiny apps so when you’re early in your Shiny journey, it can get a bit overwhelming trying to choose the best approach for your app (and that’s without even thinking about CSS!). The syntax for each approach varies, the documentation isn’t necessarily easy to follow, you don’t really know what the result might look like and it can be tough finding examples of code to help your understanding. And then on top of all those concerns, it can also be intimidating to experiment with another new tool as you find your feet with Shiny because you don’t want to break anything!

As with anything, the best way to learn is by experimenting but this guide and its associated repo are here to help you understand some of the different approaches available so you can create beautiful, functional apps sooner rather than later.

We’ll explore three popular approaches to styling Shiny apps:

* bslib
* shinydashboard
* shiny.semantic

(The apps for each framework live in folders named after the framework.)
